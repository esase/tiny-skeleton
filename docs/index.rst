Skeleton
=========

It's a trying to union all the **Tiny's** packages to make a demo web application which may be used as a foundation for you needs (as a web api server or traditional web application or even as a console app).

Installation
------------

Run the following to install this library:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require esase/tiny-skeleton


Docker Installation
-------------------

For your convenience, we prepared a docker image which includes everything to start working with the skeleton.

- Install the `docker` locally - https://docs.docker.com/install/.
- For launching the `docker` containers you need to run the command: :code:`docker-compose up -d` in the project's root dir.
- For stopping running containers you need to run the command: :code:`docker-compose stop`.


After the `docker` launching the project is available on: http://localhost:8080 or http://your.ip:8080
